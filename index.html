														<p>Advancing keyboarding skills is at the heart of many teachers. They want to see their kids typewrite
															quickly just as bad as each kid wants to be the fastest typist. Each gaming app associated with our website
															provides a different interface, theme or strategy to be utilized when participating. Some videogames feature
															different levels from easy to hard. The differentiation between each level can help give students a goal
															to strive for. This keeps the kids interested and focused on the task at hand.
															<br><br>
															Learning the entire keyboard can often be difficult. Fingers that are being used for typewriting should be limited into very few 
															in the begin. Our gaming website offers the ability to learn different portions of the keyboard at once. Home row, extended home 
															row, upper row, all letters, a combination of letters and numbers and 10-key options headline the different courses of action for
															the individual. This can benefit the teachers in the sense of a true lesson

														<p>plan. Teacher can ask everyone to start with home row keys only (with our Dance Mat and Type And Run Game)
															and then progress slowly to all letters on the keyboard with KeyMan and KeyTower. Only after each key has
															first been trained separately, it’s a good time to start to type words by playing TypingRace and TypingAttack.
															This kind of “bottom to up” learning process supports all kids.
															<br><br>
															The development of various free keyboarding online web sites (TypeTastic, BBC Dance Mat, TypeMaster, 
															TypeTrainer, TypeQuest, Typing Web, etc.) has made some incredible progress in recent history. Students
															have been able to benefit from the new innovations and teachers have gotten useful tools to promote valuable
															keyboarding skills. Nowadays keyboarding practice lessons can be more fun than ever in history! Now you 
															can arrange a short summer keyboarding camp every day.
